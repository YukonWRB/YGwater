App is currently available on Shiny Server needs changes/improvements.

1. Enable asynch programing so that one user's plot generation doesn't block another user's reactivity. Two options (see YGwater notes): asynch using futures and promises, and ExtendedTasks. asynch is likely better since it inherently blocks a user from doing further clicks/selections while their own plot is being generated.

2. Add 'Go' button to re-create plot. Currently being done reactively, but even when using debounce it's too easy to redo the plot generation while the user is selecting dates.

3. Speed up app load and plot generation function further (data.tables??)
