# Data view

## Export as .csv ideas

-   Use datatable extensions. See item 2 here: <https://rstudio.github.io/DT/extensions.html>

# Map view

## Issues

-   Map filters do not cross-update, i.e. selecting a filter that makes other filter options irrelevant does not remove those options from the other filters.

-   Add comprehensive popup labels to map markers. \### Making comprehensive popup labels in leaflet

-   Permafrost database app: <https://github.com/YukonGeologicalSurvey/PermafrostDB/blob/master/TempDataApp/app.R> Uses package leafpop, but leafpop seems to be dormant (not updated in 2 years). At least there are few imports and suggests, though with sp as a suggests it's a bit risky.

-   Other options: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29173336/how-to-display-advanced-customed-popups-for-leaflet-in-shiny> This seems to be a quite functional example with no additional package dependencies. \## Improvements
