App is currently available on Shiny Server, but in rough state.

To do:

1. Update plot tabs to use page_sidebar and accordions.

2. Update map tabs to a) work and b) use page_sidebar and accordions.

3. Explore use of shinyHugePlot

4. Create document upload and view modules

5. Make links within app:
  - From map pages to data, plots

6. Make a 'quick list' of common data download requests such as:
  - Snow survey results
  - Water quality results
  - Water level results
  
7. Create data download page
  - continuous

8. Create metadata view page (tables in app, but could also enable direct download of table using DT)
