App is currently available on Shiny Server, but in rough state.

To do:
1. Finish incorporation of 'public' parameter, which can now be set T/F when calling YGwater(). This sets the 'config' global param so it can be used in the UI as well as server files.
  - At present, only used to show/hide login button
  
2. Fix location/ loc code update for continuous plots (and check if same issue holds for discrete plots)

3. Enable asynchronous plot/report/map generation so as to not block other users. Two options:
  a) ExtendedTask. This allows a task to be sent to a worker and allows the user's session as well as other user's session to remain reactive (so the user can continue to navigate, click, etc.) https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/nonblocking/
  b) Asynchronous programming using promises and futures. This also sends a task to a worker, but the user's session is blocked until execution is done. However, other users are not blocked. https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/async/ and https://posit.co/blog/shiny-1-1-0/
  
  Both options are likely necessary, as it's sometimes desirable to force a user to wait until a task is complete before doing other things. However, for things like long-running report generation, it would be nice if the user could navigate elsewhere
  
4. Make a proper landing page instead of going straight to the map.

5. Add an 'About' page with info about the app, repo link, contact info, bug report tool (that captures app state)

6. Work through url bookmarking reactivity

7. Make links within app:
  - From map pages to data, plots, images
  - From plots to data
  
8. Make a 'quick list' of common data download requests such as:
  - Snow survey results
  - Water quality results
  - Water level results
  
9. Create data download page

10. Create document view/download page

11. Create metadata view page (tables in app, but could also enable direct download of table using DT)
