\title{Calculate standards using formulas in EQWin}
\usage{
EQWinStd(CalcId, SampleId, con = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{CalcId}{The ID identifying the calculation to perform, from column CalcId of table eqcalcs.}

\item{SampleId}{The sample ID for the calculation, from column SampleId of table eqsampls. This is required to retrieve the additional parameter values and the sample date needed for the calculation.}

\item{con}{A connection to the EQWin database. Default NULL creates a connection to the default database location and closes the connection when done.}
}
\value{
A value for the calculated standard.
}
\description{
The EQWin database stores formulas for calculating standards. This function retrieves the formula, parses it into R code, and calculates the standard for a specified parameter. As these calculations typically require additional measured values, the SampleId is also required. Note that the target parameter is NOT required; this is identified by the CalcId.
