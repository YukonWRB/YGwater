\title{Load and process snowcourse factors for discrete SWE stations}
\usage{
load_snowcourse_factors(metadata_discrete)
}
\arguments{
\item{metadata_discrete}{sf object with discrete station metadata}
}
\value{
data.frame with location IDs and basin weighting factors
}
\description{
Reads the CSV file containing weights for how much each snow course
station contributes to each SWE basin calculation. Removes duplicates and
merges with station location IDs.
}
\details{
The snowcourse factors define how measurements from individual snow course
stations are weighted when calculating basin-average SWE values. Each row
represents a station, with columns for each basin showing the contribution weight.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
weights <- load_snowcourse_factors(discrete_metadata)
# Check which basins a station contributes to
station_weights <- weights[weights$location_id == 123, ]
}
}
